# EEG Preprocessing Analysis Summary

## Overview
This analysis compares raw EEG data with preprocessed data to evaluate the effectiveness of the preprocessing pipeline.

## Preprocessing Pipeline Applied
1. **Bandpass Filter**: 0.5-50 Hz to remove noise outside the frequency range of interest
2. **Notch Filter**: 50 Hz to remove power line interference
3. **Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive feature engineering including:
   - Statistical features (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, etc.)
   - Frequency domain features (power spectral density in different bands)
   - Connectivity features (cross-correlation between channels)
   - Wavelet-based features (multi-scale analysis)
4. **Normalization**: RobustScaler to handle outliers

## Key Improvements Observed

### Signal Quality
- **Noise Reduction**: Significant reduction in high-frequency noise and artifacts
- **Power Line Interference**: 50 Hz interference effectively removed
- **Signal Clarity**: Improved signal-to-noise ratio across all channels

### Frequency Domain Effects
- **Low Frequency**: Preserved physiological signals in delta (0.5-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands
- **Alpha Band**: Enhanced clarity in alpha rhythms (8-13 Hz)
- **High Frequency Noise**: Reduced artifacts above 50 Hz
- **Power Line**: Clear attenuation at 50 Hz and harmonics

### Channel-Specific Analysis
- **Frontal Channels** (Fp1, Fp2): Reduced eye movement artifacts
- **Central Channels** (C3, C4): Improved mu rhythm visibility
- **Temporal Channels** (T3, T4, T5, T6): Better artifact removal
- **Occipital Channels** (O1, O2): Enhanced alpha activity
